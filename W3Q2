Input
--------
You are given the input in two lines:

The first line contains a positive integer k.

In the second line, you will be given a sequence of numbers terminated with a -1.
You have to find the kth occurrence of an odd integer in the sequence.

Note:  The -1 is not part of the sequence.

Output
----------
If there are k odd numbers in the sequence, then output the kth occurrence of an odd number in the sequence, if present. If there are less than k odd numbers in the sequence, output -1.

Sample Input
------------------
2

Sample Output
--------------------
3


#include <stdio.h>
int find_odd(int k)
{
    int i,n,count=0;
    scanf("%d",&n);
    while(!(n==-1))
    {
        if(n % 2!=0)
        {
            count++;
            if (count==k)
            {
                return n;
            }
            }
            scanf("%d",&n);
    }
    return -1;
}

int k;

printf("%d",find_odd(k));
return 0;
}
